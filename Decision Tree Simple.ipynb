    "The decision classifier has an attribute called tree_ which allows access to low level attributes such as node_count, the total number of nodes, and max_depth, the maximal depth of the tree. It also stores the entire binary tree structure, represented as a number of parallel arrays. The i-th element of each array holds information about the node i. Node 0 is the tree’s root. Some of the arrays only apply to either leaves or split nodes. In this case the values of the nodes of the other type is arbitrary. For example, the arrays feature and threshold only apply to split nodes. The values for leaf nodes in these arrays are therefore arbitrary.\n",
